Fake News Detection NLP Model
Overview
This project is a Fake News Detection NLP Model that classifies news articles or headlines as either fake or real. It is designed to combat misinformation by enabling automated detection of fake news using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Includes cleaning raw text, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, and stopword removal.
Feature Extraction: Utilizes techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and pre-trained word embeddings.
Classification Models: Implements machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and advanced deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT).
Evaluation Metrics: Measures performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
Deployment Ready: Easily deployable for real-time fake news detection.
